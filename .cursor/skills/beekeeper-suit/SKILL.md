description: Routing skill for the Cursor IDE Army. When the user makes a request, consult this skill to decide which Bee (subagent) owns the task and should be invoked. Each registered Bee has a guide in `guides/` describing its domain, trigger phrases, required inputs, outputs, and the situations in which it should NOT be invoked. Trigger this skill when the user's request looks like it might match a Bee's domain, when multiple Bees could plausibly handle the work, or when the user asks "who handles X?" / "which Bee does Y?".

# Beekeeper-Suit

The Beekeeper-Suit routing skill is how the primary Cursor orchestrator decides which Bee in the Army to delegate to. Each Bee owns one domain. Each Bee's domain is documented in a guide under `guides/`. This SKILL.md is the roster: a one-line index pointing to each Bee's full guide.

This Army is tuned primarily for the **Hivemind** repo (`@deeplake/hivemind`): a TypeScript/Node (ESM, Node 22) codebase that gives coding agents cloud-backed shared memory powered by Activeloop Deep Lake. Most Bees speak that stack: TypeScript + esbuild + Vitest, Deep Lake datasets and embeddings, the MCP server, the six harness integrations, and the `library/` documentation convention. There is no Django, React, Prisma, or Postgres here, and no Hivemind Bee pretends there is.

**One Bee is scoped outside Hivemind:** `hivenectar-worker-bee` owns the Hivenectar *design corpus* (a documentation repo, not a codebase). Its guide's "Do NOT route when" section keeps it from colliding with the Hivemind Bees. When a task touches Hivenectar, route to it; for everything else, the Hivemind tuning applies.

**The Army's commitment:** every registered Bee is paired with exactly one Stinger (a Cursor skill). Bees are persona plus guardrails; Stingers are the procedural arsenal. Read the guide before routing, and invoke the Bee by its `name:` frontmatter value.

The corpus IS the spec — no source code in scope | "work on Hivenectar", "extend the Hivenectar spec", "audit a Hivenectar claim", "add a deep-dive", "translate to public docs", "how does Hivenectar handle X" | [`guides/hivenectar-worker-bee.md`](guides/hivenectar-worker-bee.md) |

> **26 Bees registered.** Every Bee in this roster has a spawnable agent, a paired Stinger, and a guide in `guides/`. The 25 Hivemind Bees follow the standard layout (agent in `.cursor/agents/`, Stinger in `.cursor/skills/`); `hivenectar-worker-bee` is the exception — its Stinger lives at the standard global location (`~/.agents/skills/hivenectar-stinger/`, so the Skill tool can load it), but its **agent** (`C:\Users\mario\GitHub\hivenectar\agents\hivenectar-worker-bee.md`) lives in the Hivenectar repo alongside the corpus it owns. The Stinger references the corpus by absolute path for the same reason. To register another, add a row above and author its `guides/<bee-name>.md` from `templates/guide-template.md`.

---

## How to use this skill

1. **Match the request to a roster row.** Read the trigger keywords and the guide's "Trigger phrases" plus "Do NOT route when" sections. The negative section is as important as the positive section: it disambiguates near-overlapping Bees (for example `retrieval-worker-bee` owns recall quality while `embeddings-runtime-worker-bee` owns the embedding model that feeds it, and `deeplake-dataset-worker-bee` owns the schema underneath both).
2. **Verify the Bee's required inputs are present.** Each guide's "Inputs the Bee needs" section lists what must be supplied or inferable. If a required input is missing, batch a clarifying question rather than invoking with placeholders.
3. **Invoke the Bee by name.** The Bee's `name:` frontmatter is the routing handle (for example `typescript-node-worker-bee`).
4. **Watch for multi-Bee sequences.** Some requests legitimately need two Bees in series (build, audit, deploy). The "Multi-Bee orchestration" section below lists known sequences.

If no roster Bee matches, do not improvise a Bee. Handle the request inline, or register a new Bee (see "Adding a new Bee to the roster" below).

---

## Dispatching a Bee (the arming contract)

This is the canonical definition of how any orchestrator (`/the-beekeeper`, `/the-smoker`, or any future entry point) spawns a worker-bee. Follow it exactly; do not duplicate or paraphrase it in the calling command.

**Spawn at top level.** Use the Task tool at the main agent level. Do not nest sub-agents inside other sub-agents; Cursor cannot reliably nest-spawn.

**Arm every Bee before it starts.** Cursor does not auto-attach a skill to an agent. The spawn prompt MUST begin with this arming line:

> You are `<bee-name>`. Before doing anything else, read your paired Stinger at `.cursor/skills/<stinger-name>/SKILL.md` in full and follow it as your operating manual. Then: [scoped task, exact files in scope, definition of done, how the work will be verified].

**Resolve `<stinger-name>`.** Use the "Paired Stinger" link in the Bee's guide at `.cursor/skills/beekeeper-suit/guides/<bee-name>.md`, or apply the convention `<base>-worker-bee` -> `<base>-stinger` (for example `dependency-audit-worker-bee` -> `dependency-audit-stinger`).

**Failed dispatch rule.** A Bee dispatched without its Stinger loaded is a failed dispatch. Terminate and re-dispatch with the arming line present.

**Standard close-out.** Every implementation task ends with `security-worker-bee` (armed with `security-stinger`) first, then `quality-worker-bee` (armed with `quality-stinger`). Never run quality before security; security fixes can invalidate the QA result. See the "Plan execution loop" sequence below.

---

## Multi-Bee orchestration

Known sequences where multiple Bees run in order. Sequences are how the Army produces results larger than any single Bee.

### Plan execution loop (canonical close-out for every implementation)

1. The implementation Bee (any domain Bee) produces the code change.
2. **`security-worker-bee`** audits the Hivemind surface (SQL into Deep Lake, the pre-tool-use gate, credentials, trace PII, prompt injection, supply chain); remediates Critical and High findings in place.
3. **`quality-worker-bee`** verifies the final implementation against the source plan (completeness, correctness, alignment, regressions) and writes the QA report.

This is the canonical "is it done?" loop. Routing `quality-worker-bee` before `security-worker-bee` is a documented anti-pattern: security fixes may invalidate the QA report.

### Memory / retrieval feature

1. **`retrieval-worker-bee`** reviews, refactors, or extends recall and the skillify codify pipeline (hybrid search, BM25 fallback, the gate, propagation).
2. **`embeddings-runtime-worker-bee`** owns any change to the embedding model or daemon that feeds the FLOAT4[] columns (dim changes are a schema event).
3. **`deeplake-dataset-worker-bee`** designs or heals the tables and columns the feature reads or writes.
4. **`typescript-node-worker-bee`** owns the TypeScript implementation patterns underneath.
5. **`security-worker-bee`** then **`quality-worker-bee`** close out per the Plan execution loop.

### Compounding documentation (codebase graph + narrative)

1. **`wiki-worker-bee`** runs across code chunks using Hivemind's tree-sitter graph driver (`src/graph`), writing atomic entity pages, concept pages, ADR-detection pages, and contradiction-protocol artifacts into `library/knowledge/`.
2. **`library-worker-bee`** authors per-module narrative documentation under `library/knowledge/`, reading the entity pages at query time to enrich its narratives.

Together: `wiki-worker-bee` builds the atomic cross-reference graph; `library-worker-bee` writes the human-readable story around it. Neither replaces the other. `knowledge-worker-bee` writes the deeper private-domain narratives from ADRs and PRDs.

### Schema-touching feature

1. **`deeplake-dataset-worker-bee`** designs the table, columns, indexing, and additive heal shape (no `IF NOT EXISTS`; NOT NULL columns need a DEFAULT; append-only version-bump for skills/rules/goals/kpis).
2. The implementation Bee (`typescript-node-worker-bee`, `retrieval-worker-bee`, etc.) implements the DeeplakeApi data-access side.
3. **`embeddings-runtime-worker-bee`** is pulled in when the change touches an EMBEDDING column dimension.
4. **`security-worker-bee`** then **`quality-worker-bee`** close out per the Plan execution loop.

### Ship a release

1. The implementation Bees land the change and pass the Plan execution loop.
2. **`changelog-release-notes-worker-bee`** writes the CHANGELOG entry and release notes, and confirms the semver bump against the contract surface (CLI, library API, harness contracts, MCP tools, Deep Lake schema).
3. **`ci-release-worker-bee`** drives the build, the GitHub Actions workflows, and the npm publish (sync-versions, files allowlist, pack-check, publish-smoke-test).

> Add a sequence here whenever a new Bee is registered that fits an existing flow, or whenever a recurring multi-Bee pattern emerges in practice.

## Folder layout

- `SKILL.md` - this file (the roster plus orchestration index).
- `guides/<bee-name>.md` - one guide per registered Bee. Authored from `templates/guide-template.md`.
- `templates/guide-template.md` - the stub used to write a new Bee's Beekeeper-Suit-side guide.

---

## Adding a new Bee to the roster

To register another Bee (it must already have an agent in `.cursor/agents/` and a paired Stinger in `.cursor/skills/`):

1. Add a row to the **Roster** table above with the Bee name, domain, trigger keywords, and a link to its guide.
2. Copy `templates/guide-template.md` to `guides/<bee-name>.md` and fill it in from the Bee's agent file plus the Stinger's SKILL.md.
3. If the Bee fits an existing multi-Bee sequence (or starts a new one), update the **Multi-Bee orchestration** section.

The Bee is now discoverable. The orchestrator can find it.

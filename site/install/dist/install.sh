# Honeycomb one-command bootstrap installer (POSIX); PRD-050a, extended by the-apiary PRD-002
# (product loading + install-time telemetry, ADR-0002).
#
# Usage (the single line a brand-new user pastes):
#   curl -fsSL https://get.theapiary.sh | sh
#
# With product selection (PRD-002a):
#   curl -fsSL https://get.theapiary.sh | sh -s -- --products=honeycomb,hive,nectar
#
# Contract (PRD-050a a-AC-1..6): leave the user on a running dashboard, OR tell them in ONE plain
# sentence why not. It assumes the operator knows nothing; no Node, no npm, no idea what a daemon
# is. It is deliberately THIN and IDEMPOTENT: it detects what is already present, installs only what
# is missing, and re-running it is safe.
#
# This script owns the host-bootstrap half: detect/install Node+npm (via fnm + a pinned LTS), then
# `npm i -g @legioncodeinc/honeycomb`, plus (PRD-002b) any other SELECTED product from the fleet
# (doctor / hive / nectar), each resolved to its hive-release.json-pinned version. The
# moment a `honeycomb` bin exists it HANDS OFF to the `honeycomb install` CLI verb for the
# daemon-ensure + health-gate + dashboard-open; so that logic lives ONCE in TypeScript
# (src/commands/install.ts), not duplicated across two shell dialects.
#
# POSIX sh ONLY (no bashisms): this runs under `sh`, which may be dash/ash, not bash.
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PRD-002a; Product loading grammar (documented once, implemented identically in install.ps1)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Flags (all optional):
#   --products=<slug,slug,...>   e.g. --products=honeycomb,hive,nectar
#                                 Slugs match hive-release.json's product keys exactly:
#                                 honeycomb | doctor | hive | nectar. The pre-rename tokens
#                                 (doctor / hive / hive / nectar) are accepted
#                                 as aliases and normalized, so older invocations keep working.
#   --profile=<name>              A named preset that expands to a --products= list when
#                                 --products= itself was not given. Built-in profiles:
#                                   default -> honeycomb,doctor      (today's fixed behavior)
#                                   full    -> honeycomb,doctor,hive,nectar
#   --license=<key>               An opaque license key, threaded into the resolved selection.
#                                 No backing entitlement service exists yet (ADR-0002 Non-Goal);
#                                 this flag only makes the value resolvable for that future system.
#                                 NEVER sent in telemetry (kept off the phone-home payload).
#   --code=<code>                 A product code that resolves (via the table in
#                                 resolve_code_products/resolve_code_profile below) to a
#                                 products+profile PRESET, standing in for a longer flag
#                                 combination. Example: --code=HONEY-FULL. Unknown/expired code:
#                                 a warning is printed and the code is IGNORED (soft-fail; a
#                                 bad code must never brick the one-line install).
#   --dry-run                     Resolve everything (flags/env/config/code/profile, the pinned
#                                 manifest versions) and PRINT what would happen; performs NO
#                                 mutation (no npm install, no Node bootstrap, no registry write,
#                                 no state write, no real telemetry POST). Added by PRD-002 to make
#                                 this script's resolution logic verifiable without a real install.
#   --no-doctor                   Opt out of the Doctor watchdog (PRD-064b). The pre-rename
#                                 spelling `--no-doctor` stays accepted as an alias.
#
# Environment variable equivalents (read when the matching flag is absent):
#   HONEYCOMB_INSTALL_PRODUCTS, HONEYCOMB_INSTALL_PROFILE, HONEYCOMB_INSTALL_LICENSE,
#   HONEYCOMB_INSTALL_CODE, HONEYCOMB_NO_DOCTOR (pre-rename alias: HONEYCOMB_NO_DOCTOR).
#
# Config file (read when neither the flag nor the env var is set):
#   ~/.honeycomb/install.conf; one `KEY=value` pair per line (no spaces around `=`), `#` comments
#   and blank lines allowed. Keys: PRODUCTS, PROFILE, LICENSE, CODE. Never sourced/executed; only
#   parsed as plain text; so a config file can never inject shell code. This is the seam a repo
#   administrator uses to pin a fleet-wide deploy shape without editing the pasted command.
#
# PRECEDENCE (documented once, applies per-field): explicit flag > environment variable > config
# file > (a --code=/--profile= PRESET fills the products/profile gap only if still unset) > the
# built-in default (`honeycomb,doctor`, i.e. today's behavior, unchanged for anyone who pipes
# this script with no flags at all). `honeycomb` itself is ALWAYS part of the effective product set
# regardless of --products=, because this script IS honeycomb's own bootstrap entry point (it hands
# off to `honeycomb install` for the daemon/dashboard); there is no meaningful "install without
# honeycomb" outcome through this entry point.
#
# Combo/alias URLs (PRD-002a a-AC-4) are OPTIONAL SUGAR handled at the install SITE
# (site/install/functions/index.js), which maps a `?combo=<name>` query parameter to the
# SAME environment-variable inputs this script already reads (HONEYCOMB_INSTALL_PRODUCTS/_PROFILE) ,
# never a separate/parallel resolution mechanism. See that file for the preset table.
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PRD-002c; Install-time telemetry (fired from THIS script, independent of the Node build key)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# `install_started` fires first (before any flag/env/config resolution; c-AC-1), and exactly one
# of `install_completed` / `install_failed` fires at the terminal state (c-AC-2), via `finish()`.
# Both use a PUBLIC PostHog project key baked into the install SITE (not the Node build key); see
# `phone_home()` below. A stable anonymous install id correlates the two (c-AC-4).
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# `set -e` would abort on the FIRST non-zero command, surfacing a raw error. We instead handle every
# failure explicitly and print a plain-language line (parent AC-7); so `set -e` is intentionally OFF.

# The manifest is served by the install site itself (site/install/build.mjs copies the
